# Pet-adoption group work

# Adoption Website

## Setup
* While in `~/workspace/foundations/exercises`, make a directory called `pet-adoption`
* Create a github repository called `pet-adoption` and push up a README.md file
* Create a setup branch and push up the usual stuff

## Requirements

- As a user, I want to see a listing of all available pets. Each pet should have a card that has all this data:
```
{
Image: xxx
Name: xxx
Color: xxx
Special Skill: xxx
Type of Pet: xxx
}
```
- As a user, I want to see 3 category(type) buttons printed at the top of the page. Each should be a different color. These can be hard-coded.
- I want to be able to click one of the 3 buttons, then only the cards that are in the category(type) should show.
- There should be some way for the user to unfilter the results (ie All Pets button).
